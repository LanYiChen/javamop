# JavaMOP README

## Overview

[Monitoring-Oriented Programming (MOP)]
(http://fsl.cs.illinois.edu/mop),
is a software development and
analysis framework which aims to reduce the gap between formal
specification and implementation by allowing them together to form a
system. In MOP, runtime monitoring is supported and encouraged as a
fundamental principle for building reliable software: monitors are
automatically synthesized from specified properties and integrated
with the original system to check its dynamic behaviors during
execution. When a specification is violated or validated at runtime,
user-defined actions will be triggered, which can be any code: from
information logging to runtime recovery. 

[JavaMOP]
(http://fsl.cs.illinois.edu/javamop)
is an instance of MOP for Java.

## Install

Refer to the INSTALL.md for installing JavaMOP from the [released
zip archive](http://fsl.cs.illinois.edu/index.php/JavaMOP4).  To build
JavaMOP from sources, please download the [source
code](https://github.com/runtimeverification/javamop), and refer to
the src/README.md.


## Usage

Refer to docs/Usage.md for detailed instructions on how to use JavaMOP.
