For each eg used in unit-testing we should have:

1. mop spec file
2. trusted ast for the mop spec file
3. trusted .aj output string and .rvm output string

==
Implement function to test:
1) whether the untrusted implementation of parse function 
can derive the same ast from the given mop spec file as the
trusted ast for the spec file.

core: compare whether two ast are the same.
two steps~
i) check shape (same structure)
ii) compare the equality of dumped strings


2) whether the same output will be generated from the same ast
for the system under test:
input: the trusted ast
read the ast, then generate actual .aj and .rvm

compare with the expected ones: equality of strings.
